            In a world where we have finally learned how to rid people of their worst fears, you play as a <strong>PsychoSurgeon</strong> - a specialist given the task of going into their patient's mind tofight the deepest, darkest enemies of their psyche.
            Use your powers to face the innate human fears that metastasize only in dreams. Each puzzle presents the player with new challenges, obstacles, and enemies to overcome in order to reclaim the client's psyche.

        <p>Psychosurgeon is a surreal first-person action-platformer made especially for Stereoscopic 3D that pits the player against a nightmarish twisted dreamscape. Developed in Unity, Psychosurgeon was developed by <a href="http://fourthreestudios.com/tfdGames/">Tiger Fighting Dragons</a>, a student game-development studio, over the course of one semester.</p>
        <h3>Press</h3>
        <blockquote>
            Despite bugs and criticism – no video game has ever existed without either – the crowd enjoyed PsychoSurgeon. “We got the ‘wows’ and the ‘oohs’ that we wanted to hear, when we wanted to hear them,” said Bronkhorst. Getting positive response – especially for a game made in three months – would have been enough for anyone. However, PsychoSurgeon ended up winning “Best Graphics” and “Best Gameplay” in the class.
