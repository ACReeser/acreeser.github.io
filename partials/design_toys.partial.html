        A coffee-pot status web app, originally proposed as a joke, now made real. Allows coffee pot fill level tracking, as well as pot temperature and coffee supply contribution lists.  Meant to be paired with the postpot coffeepot sensor.

        <h3>Favorite Feature: Muggy</h3>
        <p>A humorous talking mug mascot was included because the layout was very condensed and used little screen real estate.</p>
        <p>
            Muggy cycles through several coffee-based sayings to keep spirits high.
        </p>
        <p>
            Muggy was one of the first interesting things I made using SVG editors. His flat design and basic and exaggerated features made him an excellent beginner's study.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mug mascot was borrowed from a relatively obscure video game character from the <i>Old World Blues</i> DLC for <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i>.
